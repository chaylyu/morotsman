So I decided to add Google analytics to my blog and now I can blog about it, so very meta of me :-)

The blog is hosted by Github Pages using Jekyll by the way.

## Get Google Analytics account

### Get the account

The first thing you have to do is to get a Google analytics account: [Google analytics]. This is pretty self explaining (+ I forgot to take a screenshot) so I will not elaborate on this.

### Copy some stuff you will need to setup Jekyll

After you have create an account you will receive a Tracking Id that looks like this: UA-XXXXXXXXX-X. If you for some reason forget the Tracking Id it is available at: Admin/Tracking info/Tracking code

You will also need the code snippet in Global Sit Tag:

{% highlight Ruby %}
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-XXXXXXXXX-X"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());

  gtag('config', 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-X');
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

If you copy paste from this post, please remember to replace UA-XXXXXXXXX-X (two places) with the Tracking id for your site.

![Tracking code]({{ site.url }}/assets/adding_ga/Tracking_code.png){:height="120%" width="120%"}


## Setup Jekyll

### Update _config.yml

Add the following row:

{% highlight Ruby %}
google_analytics: UA-XXXXXXXXX-X
{% endhighlight %}

![Tracking code]({{ site.url }}/assets/adding_ga/config.png){:height="80%" width="80%"}

You now know the drill about replacing UA-XXXXXXXXX-X with the Tracking Id from Google analytics, I will not mention it again (but you will have to do that in the next step as well).

## Add google-analytics.html

Create a new file called google-analytics.html in the _includes directory (I also had to create the directory)

![Tracking code]({{ site.url }}/assets/adding_ga/Directory.png){:height="80%" width="80%"}


And then add the code snippet from Google Analytics like this:

{% highlight Ruby %}
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UA-XXXXXXXXX-X"></script>
<script>
	window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
	function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
	gtag('js', new Date());

	gtag('config', 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-X');
</script>
{% endhighlight %}

And that's it, the setup is completed!

## Head back to Google analytics

Time to celebrate and observe in realtime that the blog has zero visitors, but hey it's in realtime!

![Tracking code]({{ site.url }}/assets/adding_ga/visitors.png){:height="100%" width="100%"}

Ok, so now that you have added google analytics to your blog, why not stay for a while, relax and maybe read a couple of blog posts about [covariance], [contravariance] or even [functional bliss]? There will be quotes from Lord of the rings, funny gif's and much more.
